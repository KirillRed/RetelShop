# RetelShop
## Introduction
---
RetelShop is new online shop developed by me(Kirill Redenskiy). It is my training site. Note that there isn't frontend, only backend(except 2 html files). So if you want to check how site works, you can use special software like Postman.
## Getting started
---
First download python 3.8 or higher (note that python 3.7 or less will not work) on this [link](https://www.python.org "python")  
Download code and then go to repository
Then download requirements:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Then migrate database(migrations is already in github project):
```
python manage.py migrate
```
Then run server and enjoy my site:
```
python manage.py runserver
```
## Technologies and features
---
My site is written on [django](https://www.djangoproject.com "django"). I also use [django rest framework](https://www.django-rest-framework.org "django rest framework") for apis. In my site there is chat which is written via [django channels](https://channels.readthedocs.io/en/stable/introduction.html "django channels") and there is also chatbot written via [chatterbot](https://chatterbot.readthedocs.io/en/stable/, "chatterbot"). And of course there are shop features like list of comperison, cart and wish list.
